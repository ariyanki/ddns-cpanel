Read more detail on my site article [www.ariyanki.net](http://www.ariyanki.net/php/?act=read&id=143)

Usually ISP (Internet Service Providers) assign you a different IP-address each time you connect to the net via modem, ISDN or xDSL.

if you want to have an internet domain name (or URL) to go with that IP-address, you have to configure that IP-address with Dynamic DNS.

Read this about Dynamic DNS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS

How does it work? Your server contacts the Dynamic DNS server at regular intervals (or whenever its necessary), to report its current IP number and update the mapping.

If you have a web hosting, you have permission to change your dns zone, and your web hosting have API, you can make your own dynamic dns server with your internet domain name.
